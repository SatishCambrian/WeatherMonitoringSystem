Assignment: Weather Monitoring System

Objective: Create a weather monitoring system where weather data is collected and multiple displays are updated when the weather changes.

Details:

WeatherData (Singleton): This is the subject of the Observer pattern and also a Singleton. It collects weather data from a weather station (for simplicity, you can simulate this by randomly generating data). When the data changes, it notifies all observers.

IDisplay (Interface): This is the interface for all display elements. It includes a single method Display() that shows the current weather data on the display.

CurrentConditionsDisplay (Observer and Decorator): This is one of the observers. It displays the current weather conditions. Itâ€™s also a decorator that can add additional information (like date and time) to the display.

StatisticsDisplay (Observer): This is another observer. It displays weather statistics (like average, max, and min temperatures).

ForecastDisplay (Observer): This is yet another observer. It displays a weather forecast based on the current weather data.

WeatherStation (Factory): This is a factory for creating different types of displays.
